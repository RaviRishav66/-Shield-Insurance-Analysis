## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview

In this project, I built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Shield Insurance to analyze and visualize key business metrics. The dashboard helps track revenue, customer growth, sales modes, and age group segmentation, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.

This end-to-end project involved data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and creating interactive reports to simplify complex insurance data into actionable insights.

## Problem Statement-

Shield Insurance aims to enhance its data-driven decisions by implementing a dashboard that delivers clear and actionable insights. To explore a partnership with AtliQ Technologies, they have proposed a pilot project to assess our capabilities. 

This project will help them evaluate how effectively we can meet their requirements before moving forward with a full-scale implementation. The outcome of this pilot will play a key role in determining the possibility of a larger, long-term collaboration.
